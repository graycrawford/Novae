# Novae

#VR particle experiences

A series of VR particle experiences using Unity's Visual Effect Graph.
Requires a Leap Motion and Oculus Rift.


Novae 1 and 4 use two hands.
The right hand interacts with the particles directly / locally, and the left hand's xyz controls the particles globally.
Novae 3 uses only the right hand.
