# Novae

A series of VR particle experiences using Unity's Visual Effect Graph.
First shown https://twitter.com/graycrawford/status/1118939118875107329
Requires a Leap Motion and Oculus Rift.


Novae 1 and 4 use two hands.
The right hand interacts with the particles directly / locally, and the left hand's xyz controls the particles globally.
Novae 3 uses only the right hand.
